Excelsior JET Maven Plugin
=====

*Excelsior JET Maven Plugin* provides Maven users with an easy way to compile their applications
down to optimized native Windows, OS X, or Linux executables with [Excelsior JET](http://excelsiorjet.com).
Such precompiled applications start and often work faster, do not depend on the JRE,
and are as difficult to reverse engineer as if they were written in C++.

### Prerequisites
Before using this plugin, you need to install Excelsior JET.
You may find a fully functional evaluation version of Excelsior JET [here](http://www.excelsiorjet.com/evaluate).
It is free for evaluation purposes and the only limitation it has is that it expires 90 days
after installation, along with all compiled applications.

**Note:** Excelsior JET does not yet support cross-compilation, so you need to build your application on each target platform
separately. The supported platforms are Windows (32- and 64-bit), Linux (32- and 64-bit), and OS X (64-bit).
  

### Overview

The current version of the plugin supports very basic functionality.
It can only handle *plain Java SE applications*, i.e. applications that have a main class
and all their dependencies are explicitly listed in the JVM classpath at launch time.
In other words, if your application can be launched using a command line
of the following form:
    
```
java -cp [dependencies-list] [main class]
```
and loads classes mostly from jars that are present
in the `dependencies-list`, then you can use this plugin.

This plugin will transform your application into an optimized native executable for the platform
on which you run Maven, and place it into a separate directory together with all required
Excelsior JET runtime files. In addition, it can either pack that directory into a zip archive
(all platforms) or create an Excelsior Installer setup (Windows and Linux only).
    
Excelsior JET supports many more features than this plugin.
We plan to cover all those features in the future.


### Usage

You need to copy and paste the following configuration into the `<plugins>` section of
your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<plugin>
	<groupId>com.excelsiorjet</groupId>
	<artifactId>excelsior-jet-maven-plugin</artifactId>
	<version>0.3.0</version>
	<configuration>
		<mainClass></mainClass>
	</configuration>
</plugin>
```

set the `<mainClass>` parameter, and use the following command line to build the application:

```
mvn jet:build
```

### Excelsior JET Installation Directory Lookup

In order to do its job, the plugin needs to locate an Excelsior JET installation.
You have three ways to specify the Excelsior JET installation directory explicitly:

- add the `<jetHome>` parameter to the `<configuration>` section of the plugin
- pass the `jet.home` system property on the Maven command line as follows:
```
mvn jet:build -Djet.home=[JET-Home]
```
- or set the `JET_HOME` O/S environment variable

If none of above is set, the plugin searches for an Excelsior JET installation along the `PATH`.
So if you only have one copy of Excelsior JET installed, the plugin should be able to find it on Windows right away,
and on Linux and OS X - if you have run the Excelsior JET `setenv` script prior to launching Maven.

### Configurations other than `<mainСlass>`
For a complete list of parameters, look into the Javadoc of `@Parameter` field declarations
in the  [JetMojo](https://github.com/excelsior-oss/excelsior-jet-maven-plugin/blob/master/src/main/java/com/excelsiorjet/maven/plugin/JetMojo.java)
class. Most of them have default values derived from your `pom.xml` project
such as `<outputName>` parameter specifying resulting executable name.

There are also two useful Windows-specific configuration parameters:

`<hideConsole>true</hideConsole>` – hide console

`<icon>`*icon-file*`</icon>` – set executable icon (in Windows .ico format)

It is recommended to place the executable icon into a VCS, and if you place it to
`${project.basedir}/src/main/jetresources/icon.ico`, you do not need to explicitly specify it
in the configuration. The plugin uses the location `${project.basedir}/src/main/jetresources`
for other Excelsior JET-specific resource files (such as the EULA for Excelsior Installer setups).

**NEW in 0.2.0 release:**
##### Excelsior Installer Configurations

Starting from 0.2.0 release, the plugin supports creation of Excelsior Installer setups -
conventional installer GUIs for Windows or self-extracting archives with command-line interface
for Linux.

To create an Excelsior Installer setup, add the following configuration into the plugin
`<configuration>` section:

`<packaging>excelsior-installer</packaging>`

Excelsior Installer setup, in turn, has the following configurations:

* `<product>`*product-name*`</product>` - default is `${project.name}`

* `<vendor>`*vendor-name*`</vendor>` -  default is `${project.organization.name}`

* `<version>`*product-version*`</version>` - default is `${project.version}`

* `<eula>`*end-user-license-agreement-file*`</eula>` - default is `${project.basedir}/src/main/jetresources/eula.txt`

* `<eulaEncoding>`*eula-file-encoding*`</eulaEncoding>` - default is `autodetect`. Supported encodings are US-ASCII (plain text), UTF16-LE

* `<installerSplash>`*installer-splash-screen-image*`</installerSplash>` - default is `${project.basedir}/src/main/jetresources/installerSplash.bmp`

##### Windows Version-Information Resource Configurations

On Windows, the plugin automatically adds a
[version-information resource](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms646981%28v=vs.85%29.aspx)
to the resulting executable. This can be disabled by specifying the following
configuration:

    <addWindowsVersionInfo>false</addWindowsVersionInfo>

By default, the values of version-information resource strings are derived from project settings.
The values of `<product>` and `<vendor>` configurations are used verbatim as
`ProductName` and `CompanyName` respectively;
other defaults can be changed using the following configuration parameters:

* `<winVIVersion>`*version-string*`</winVIVersion>` - version number (both `FileVersion` and `ProductVersion` strings are set to this same value)

    **Notice:** unlike Maven `${project.version}`, this string must have format `v1.v2.v3.v4`, where vi is a number.
    The plugin would use heuristics to derive a correct version string from the specified value if the latter
    does not meet this requirement, or from `${project.version}` if this configuration is not present.

* `<winVICopyright>`*legal-copyright*`</winVICopyright>` - `LegalCopyright` string, with default value derived from other parameters

* `<winVIDescription>`*executable-description*`</winVIDescription>` - `FileDescription` string, default is `${project.name}`

**NEW in 0.3.0 release:**
##### Startup accelerator configurations
The Startup Accelerator improves the startup time of executables compiled with Excelsior JET.
Since 0.3.0 version, the plugin automatically runs the compiled application immediately after build,
collects the necessary profile information and hard-wires it into the executable just created.
The JET Runtime will then use the information to reduce the application startup time.
The Startup Accelerator is enabled by default, but you may disable it by specifying the following
configuration:

    <profileStartup>false</profileStartup>

You may specify the duration of the profiling session in seconds by specifying the following
configuration:

    <profileStartupTimeout>duration in seconds</profileStartupTimeout>

As the specified period has elapsed, the profiling stops and the running application is automatically terminated,
so ensure the timeout value is large enough to capture the application startup.
On the other hand, you may close the application manually if the profiling timeout proves to be excessively long.

### Performing a Test Run
Since 0.3.0 version  of the plugin, you can run your Java application before compiling it to native code
(Excelsior JET Runtime will be used to execute application’s bytecodes) which helps Excelsior JET:

* verify that your application can successfully be executed on Excelsior JET JVM.
  Usually, if the test run completes normally the compiled application also runs well.
* detect what parts of Java Runtime is used by your application.
  For instance, JavaFX Webkit is not included by default to your resulting natively compiled package,
  but if it will be used during a Test Run, it will be included.
* collect profile information to optimize your app more effectively

To perform a test run, execute the following Maven command:

```
mvn jet:testrun
```

The plugin will place gathered profiles to  `${project.basedir}/src/main/jetresources`.
It is recommended to commit the profiles (.usg, .startup) to VCS to allow the plugin
to use the profiles during automatic application builds without performing the Test Run.

Note: 64-bit versions of Excelsior JET do not collect `.usg` profile yet.
      So it is recommended to perform the Test Run on a 32-bit Excelsior JET version at least once.

The profiles will be used by:

* the [Startup Optimizer](http://www.excelsior-usa.com/doc/jet/jetw015.html)
* the [Global Optimizer](http://www.excelsior-usa.com/doc/jet/jetw014.html) (will be supported by the plugin in the version).

Note: the application is run in a special TEST MODE so disregard its modest start-up time and performance on this step.

### Build process

The native build is performed in the `jet` subdirectory of the Maven target build directory.
First, the plugin copies the main application jar to the `jet/build` directory,
and copies all its run time dependencies to `jet/build/lib`.
Then it invokes the Excelsior JET AOT compiler to compile all those jars into a native executable.
Upon success, it copies that executable and the required Excelsior JET Runtime files
into the `jet/app` directory, and binds the executable to that copy of the Runtime.

> Your natively compiled application is ready for distribution at this point: you may copy
> contents of the `jet/app` directory to another computer that has neither Excelsior JET nor
> the Oracle JRE installed, and the executable should work as expected.

Finally, the plugin packs the contents of the `jet/app` directory into
a zip archive named `${project.build.finalName}.zip` so as to aid single file re-distribution.
**New in 0.2.0:** On Windows and Linux, you can set the `<packaging>excelsior-installer</packaging>`
configuration parameter to have the plugin create an Excelsior Installer setup instead.

In the future, the plugin will also support the creation of OS X app bundles.

## Sample Project

To demonstrate the process and result of plugin usage, we have forked the [JavaFX VNC Client](https://github.com/comtel2000/jfxvnc) project on GitHub, added the Excelsior JET plugin to its `pom.xml` file, and run it through Maven to build native binaries for three platforms.

You can download the binaries from here:

* [Windows (32-bit, 46MB)](http://www.excelsior-usa.com/download/jet/maven/jfxvnc-ui-1.0.0-windows-x86.zip)
* [OS X (64-bit, 45MB)](http://www.excelsior-usa.com/download/jet/maven/jfxvnc-ui-1.0.0-osx-amd64.zip)
* [Linux (64-bit, 45MB)](http://www.excelsior-usa.com/download/jet/maven/jfxvnc-ui-1.0.0-linux-amd64.zip)

or clone [the project](https://github.com/pjBooms/jfxvnc) and build it yourself:

```
    git clone https://github.com/pjBooms/jfxvnc
    cd jfxvnc/ui
    mvn jet:build
```

## Roadmap

Even though we are going to base the plugin development on your feedback in the future, we have our own short-term plan as well.
So the next few releases will add the following features:

* [Java Runtime Slim-Down](http://www.excelsiorjet.com/solutions/java-download-size).
* Mapping of compiler and packager options to plugin configuration parameters.
* Creation of Mac OS X application bundles.
* Code signing.
* Tomcat Web Applications support.

Note that the order of appearance of these features is not fixed and can be adjusted based on your feedback.
